### Installing

The easiest way to install is using Pi-apps (click the banner above), but debs are available in the root of this repository.

### Fixing "Old build detected"

Make sure you have `npm` installed, simply run [snapdrop-updater.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanfortner/snapdrop-rpi/master/snapdrop-updater.sh).
